The data used to build the historiographic network were taken from all the available bibliographic sources presenting a list of performances representative of Italian Avant-garde Theatre. The Incommon network focuses instead on the case studies chosen by the project and is built using both bibliographic sources and data from the collected archival documents. The aim is to highlight how different practices of documentation and historicization produce distinct results in building the shape of a theatre scene.

        is based on force-directed graph drawing algorithm01, meaning that the

        The relationships that link people and events are of different types such as
        acting, directing, writing, and music. The network can be
        filtered according to these criteria, displaying only a portion of the
        community. A search bar{" "}

        connections, offering a fluid and frictionless navigation through the
