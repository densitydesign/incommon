    <div>
      <span className={"title-panel"}>Catalogue</span> displays documents in a
      grid layout that can be filtered according to different criteria. The
      catalogue maintains the traditional conception of materials as documents,
      but the filtrable grid offers the needed ‘contextual pressure’01 to
      stimulate new readings of documents as collections. The view exploits the
      grid as a format for collection: when displayed next to each other,
      documents become part of a collection, which the user can modify by
      applying various filters, prompting new visual sequences. Images can be
      visualised as single items or folded into binders when they belong to the
      same documents. By clicking on one item, the document card opens up,
      showing the associated metadata.
